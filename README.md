## Among the main attributes is nofollow, but what is NoFollow?

nofollow is an attribute (rel=”NoFollow”) inserted in the HTML that serves to instruct search engines that a certain hyperlink should not be followed and that your destination page should not receive link juice from the source page. That is, the page to which the link points can be accessed normally by the user, but will not receive influence from the origin page. A link with a nofollow attribute pointing to your site is not considered relevant to `crawlers`.

## And what is a Crawler?

Crawler, also known as Spider or Bot, is a robot used by search engines to find and index pages on a website. It captures information from the pages and registers the links found, making it possible to find other pages and keeping its database updated. There are tools that facilitate the work of crawlers and make the indexing of a site's pages faster, such as a sitemap.
